#Plan-Direct
>Conquer Your Days

##Project Overview
- Journal to record daily life
- Planner to chart to-do's 
- When user needs to go to location, embedded Geolocator can fetch directions

##Features
Upon opening the app, user sees a monthly calendar and a blank journal page. Typing in the journal auto records the entry date. After writing, the user clicks on 'save entry' button, and a new button appears: 'create new entry'.
Clicking on a specific day on the calendar brings up the day and a blank to do list. A plain list can be created, random entries in a non-specific order. User can also organize by location, which geolocator can give directions.
User can also click on 'notes' button above list page, to add notes such as numbers, things of interest, etc.
